#+TITLE: Vibe coding prototype in Common Lisp

* Introduction

In Lisp, you can define functions like this

#+begin_src lisp
  (defun factorial (n)
    "Compute the factorial of N (N!)."
    (if (<= n 1)
        1
        (* n (factorial (1- n))))))
#+end_src

But what if you could just write

#+begin_src lisp
  (vibe factorial (n) "Compute the factorial of n")
#+end_src

Well now you can!

Lisp supports Macros and so the language is extensible. The =vibe=
macro prompts OpenAI GPT-5 to write the function defun and then
compiles it.

This is a simple demonstration / prototype only.

* Configuration

You must set your OpenAI key either explicitly as =(setf openai:
*openai-api-key* "my key")= or by setting the shell variable
=OPENAI_API_KEY=.
